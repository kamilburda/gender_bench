- Changes Made: We extracted the lexicons from Table 20. We filled in the words
that had asterisks with appropriate suffixes. Ability, Standout,
Leadership, Masculine, Agentic, and Professional lexicons are considered as
male. Feminine, Communal, and Personal are considered female. This reflects two
stereotypes: (1) Warmth-competence stereotype content model that describes men
as competent and women as warm, (2) Career-family stereotype model that
describes men as focused on their careers, while women are focused on their
families.
